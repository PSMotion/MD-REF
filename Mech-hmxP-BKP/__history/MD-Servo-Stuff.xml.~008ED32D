    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">The function of a stage is to constrain motion to a desired direction. For a linear stage, the desired motion is along an ideal straight line. Any motion in a constrained direction will contribute to deviation from the ideal trajectory and/or position. Other contributors to deviations include load forces and everything associated with the formidable task of designing and constructing a perfect stage in a world where perfect machining and ideal materials do not exist. To put it mildly, high performance motion systems are complex, so overlooking a seemingly small issue, either in design or in an application, can produce undesirable results. Thus, the intended use of a product along with the various measures of performance must be thoroughly reviewed.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Unfortunately, many of the terms used by suppliers and users of motion systems mean different things to different people. In an effort to reduce confusion and misunderstanding, we use terms and definitions consistent with ASME B5.57 and ISO-230. Where terminologies in the referenced standards are not in harmony with or do not address an area, we have used those which are common to the motion industry. An understanding of each and a discussion of the application with a Newport Application Engineer will help in selecting a system to accomplish the intended goal. The referenced standards served as a guide in the development of the Newport test procedure.</text></para>

All motions described here follow the right-hand coordinate system convention. The cross-product of the +X and +Y axes (second and third fingers) is the +Z axis (thumb). Also, if the thumb of the right hand points in the positive direction of an axis, the fingers will wrap around the axis in the direction of positive rotation about that axis. All movements are composed of translations along and/or rotations about the coordinate axes. Generally, the X and Y axes are on the horizontal plane, the direction of travel of the first or bottom stage being aligned with the X axis, and the Z-axis as vertical.</text></para>

It is not the same as the Minimum Incremental Motion. A system may or may not be able to consistently make incremental moves equal to the resolution. Factors that can affect a move include friction, load, external forces, system dynamics, controller, vibrations, and inertia. (See also the discussion about Minimum Incremental Motion.)</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Minimum Incremental Motion (MIM) is the smallest increment of motion a device is capable of consistently and reliably delivering. It should not be confused with resolution, which is typically based on the smallest controller display value or smallest encoder increment. Resolution can be significantly smaller than the smallest actual motion output, a key distinction, but unfortunately very rarely disclosed. Newport specifies the minimum incremental motion with most of its products. Others refer to it as &quot;practical resolution&quot;. Two different test methods are used depending on the capabilities of the stage.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">With stages where the minimum incremental motion is limited by friction in the drive train, a high number of small incremental motion is commanded in the forward and then in the reverse direction. The actual displacement with each step is measured with an external tool like a laser interferometer or an autocollimator. It is important to use an external tool for this measurement as the encoder position might indicate an accurate display, but the actual motion of the stage carriage does not match this encoder displacement. As a rule of thumb, Newport specifies as Minimum Incremental Motion, the smallest step size where 3X the standard deviation of the actual displacements is smaller than the commanded step size. This ensures that an individual step will result in a real displacement within a certain tolerance. Figure 2 shows the results of such a measurement for an MFA-CC linear stage. In the graphical representation, the distribution of the actual displacements is shown, resulting in an MIM of 0.1µm. This test method allows a detailed analysis of the stage’s backlash (no output motion when reversing direction of motion) and hysteresis (non-linear output motion when reversing direction of motion due to elastic forces in the drive train) of the stage at the same time.</text></para>

A smaller number of incremental motion is commanded in the forward and then in the reverse direction and the actual position is recorded at a high frequency. Again, the actual position is measured with an external tool, which can be quite different from the encoder position. The high temporal measurement allows a precise analysis of the temporal response of the stage and an exact determination of the position noise. As a rule of thumb, MIM is specified as 2X the peak-to peak position noise, in this case 0.02µm. Figure 3 shows such a measurement for the IMS-LM linear stages.</text></para>

Figure 2 is a graphical representation of Backlash and Hysteresis.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Backlash</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Backlash is a component of the reversal value. It is the result of relative movement between interacting mechanical parts of a drive system that does not produce output motion. Contributing factors include clearance between mechanical parts such as gear teeth and mechanical deformation. Although not all systems have backlash, backlash affects bi-directional repeatability and accuracy. However, backlash is usually quite repeatable and can thus be compensated for by all Newport controllers in many applications. Backlash also affects precision alignment and tracking applications as it provides a discontinuity between commanded motion and output motion when reversing direction. Hence, 100% compensation for backlash is not recommended for these applications which may lead to undesirable results.</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Hysteresis is a component of the reversal value that is dependent on the recent history of the system. It is observed when the forces acting on a system reverse direction and is the result of elastic forces in the various components. It affects both bi-directional repeatability and accuracy. Hysteresis can also affect precision alignment and tracking applications as the output motion is not linear to the input motion when reversing the direction of motion. Different than backlash, hysteresis is present in all mechanical systems even if its value might be low.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Accuracy</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Accuracy is a measure of the degree to which a given displacement, linear or rotary, conforms to an agreed upon standard. The accuracy of a motion system can be highly influenced by the test set up, environmental conditions, and the procedure used to measure displacement. In the micron and submicron world, thermal expansion can have a profound impact upon accuracy, particularly when temperatures are not constant or well controlled. Other common parameters that adversely affect accuracy include cosine error and Abbe error. Additionally, undesired motion in any of the six degrees of freedom will produce added uncertainty. For multi-axis systems, the influence of a combination of stages must be considered.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Accuracy is sometimes confused with incremental motion. For example, consider a screw-driven stage. If the drive screw has a pitch of 1 mm and is directly driven by a 200 step-per-revolution stepper motor, this does not necessarily mean the stage has an accuracy of 0.005 mm (proportional to one motor step). Variations in screw pitch and motor step angle must be included in accuracy analysis. Likewise, a stage utilizing a glass scale encoder has its own accuracy considerations that must be taken into account. The latter includes scale accuracy, alignment of the scale to the stage axis of motion (cosine error), alignment between read head and scale, and interpolation of the encoder signal.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Newport&apos;s accuracy and other performance measurements are conducted in a well-controlled environment (20 degrees Celsius with corrections made for atmospheric pressure and humidity). Tests are conducted in accordance with a written procedure that governs the set up, method, equipment and data analysis. Recognized national and international standards, including ISO-230 and ASME B5.57, guided the establishment of our procedure. All pertinent equipment is carefully maintained, regularly calibrated in accordance with accepted procedures and traceable to recognized national standards.</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Absolute Accuracy is the actual output of a system versus the commanded or ideal input. It is more intuitively called inaccuracy. For example, when a motion system is commanded to move 10 mm and actually moves 9.99 mm, as measured by a perfect ruler and a test procedure that conforms to suitable standards, the deviation from the commanded position is 0.01 mm. Accuracy may be expressed per unit distance of travel or over the full travel of the stage. For example, a 200 mm travel stage may be specified as having an accuracy of 5 micrometers per 100 mm of travel or possibly 8 micrometers over its full travel. Newport specifications state how accuracy is to be interpreted for each product.</text></para>

Linear or monotonically increasing errors include cosine error, inaccuracy of the lead screw pitch, angular deviation at the measuring point (Abbe error), and thermal expansion effects. Graphically, these errors can be approximated by the slope of a best fit, straight line on a plot of position versus deviation (Figure 7). Knowing the slope of this line (error/travel), we can approximate absolute accuracy as: Absolute Accuracy = On-Axis Accuracy + (Slope x Travel)</text></para>

For this reason, it is important to have sufficient understanding of the inherent abilities of the components that make up a stage.

The bearings define also the stiffness of the stage, but not in the direction of travel, and the static load capacity of a stage. The dynamic load capacity, however, is primarily limited by the rigidity of the drive train and the power of the motor, and not by the bearings.</text></para>

They consist of two flat surfaces sliding against each other with the geometry shown in Figure 1. Dovetail slides can provide long travel, and have relatively high stiffness and load capacity. They are more resistant to shock than other types of bearings and are fairly immune to contamination. However, they do have relatively high stiction, and the friction varies with translation speed, which makes precise control difficult and limits sensitivity.</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Ball bearing slides reduce friction by replacing sliding motion with rolling motion. Balls are constrained by vee-ways or hardened steel rods, as shown in Figure 2. The bearing ways are preloaded against the balls to eliminate unwanted runout in the bearings. Even with this preload, the friction is very low resulting in extremely smooth travel. Ball bearing slides are relatively insensitive to contamination because each ball contacts the guide ways at only a single point, allowing debris to be pushed out of the way.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Since the contact area available to transmit loads is smaller in vee-grooved bearing ways, ball bearings have a lower load capacity than crossed-roller or other bearings. In order to carry the same sized load, the balls would need to be larger in diameter or be greater in quantity. If the bearing ways are ground with an arch or circular groove (see Figure 3), the closer the conformity to the balls’ radii increases the contact area. This allows the use of smaller balls than with flat ways.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Most ball bearing slides make 4 contact points with the bearing ways with a 45° angle to the axis of the ball rotation. Although this provides an equal load ratio, it also introduces some differential slip as those contact points of the bearings that are closer to the rotation axis move faster than the contact points that are further away. Differential slip introduces friction and wear and can be performance and speed limiting. Double-row ball bearing slides with gothic profile grooves and two contact points minimize differential slip and provide higher load capacity.</text></para>

This is a result of replacing the point contact of a spherical ball with the line contact of a cylindrical roller. Due to the averaging characteristic of line contacts, angular and linear deviations are generally lower than those found in ball bearings. However, crossed-roller bearings require more care during manufacture and assembly, resulting in higher costs. Crossed-roller bearings are also more sensitive to contamination because they are less effective at pushing foreign particles away from contact with the guide ways.</text></para>

These modules travel along a precision ground rail on each side of the stage base track and rails (see Figure 5). Recirculating bearings are typically not as smooth as linear bearings, since the balls or rollers must enter and exit the preload region. However, they allow for very long travel ranges and provide a higher load capacity for applications with off-center axial loads. In addition and by design, there is no bearing cage migration (bearing cages moving off their center position). This is an issue with linear bearing stages used for high duty cycle or vertical applications.</text></para>

Additional advantages of ball screws are predictable service life and lower wear rate. However, ball screws are not self-locking, which limits their use in vertical applications.

In order to eliminate Backlash, the worm and the worm wheel need to be in perfect contact to each other which requires a sophisticated worm preloading system with high transversal stiffness.

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">The location in the motion system from which the feedback device performs its measurements directly affects the quality of the data fed back to the controller. The closer the feedback device is to the object being controlled, the more effective it will be in helping the controller achieve the desired result. When controlling position, for example, measuring the linear position of the stage carriage directly provides higher quality feedback than measuring the angular position of the lead screw and inferring carriage position through knowledge of the drive train architecture between the encoder and the carriage (see Figure 12). The former, known as direct output metrology, avoids the drive train induced errors like backlash, hysteresis, and windup that can affect the latter type, known as indirect metrology.</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Rotary shaft encoders provide a low cost way to confirm rotary motor position. They are an ideal feedback mechanism for screw driven stages. With Newport stages, the rotary encoder is directly attached to the leadscrew, ballscrew or worm screw whenever possible. This eliminates errors due to belt, gear or coupling wind-up or backlash, but the final position output still depends on the accuracy of the leadscrew or ballscrew.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Most rotary encoders are quadrature encoders which means that they have two digital output signals, offset by 90°. These signals are commonly called channel A and channel B (Figure 13). The addition of channel B provides direction information in the feedback signal. The ability to detect direction is critical if encoder rotation stops on a pulse edge. Without the ability to decode direction, the counter may count each transition through the rising edge of the signal and will lose position. Another benefit of the quadrature signal scheme is the ability to identify 4 positions per encoder cycle based on the rising and falling edges of channel A and channel B. Rotary encoders are typically characterized by the cycles per revolution (CPR), however, when characterized by points per revolution or counts per revolution, the quadrature is taken into account.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Many rotary encoders also have a feature called the index pulse. An index pulse occurs once per encoder revolution. It is used to establish an absolute mechanical reference position within one encoder count of an encoder revolution. Using the index pulse signal for homing in combination with the home switch or mechanical zero signal, improves the homing repeatability of most screw driven stages.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Direct Reading Encoders</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">While rotary shaft encoders are both effective and low-cost devices, all they really tell us is the angular position of a motor shaft. There are a number of error sources like leadscrew cumulative and periodic errors, thermal expansion, screw wind-up, or nut backlash that cause inaccuracies between position information derived from a rotary encoder and the real position of the load. Although it is physically impossible to mount a position feedback device in the same exact place as the user’s load, it can be mounted nearby, indicating the actual position more accurately. This is the primary advantage of direct reading encoders.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">A direct reading encoder consists of a long linear scale and a compact read-head. The scale is directly attached to the carriage and the position of the carriage is directly read by the stationary read head. In some systems, the scale is stationary and the read head is moving. For rotary stages, a large diameter rotary disk is attached to the rotating platen. Most direct encoders used with high precision stages are non-contact optical devices.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Direct reading encoders are available in many different grades. Most common are steel scales with a 20 µm signal period. Higher quality scales are available in glass and can feature a 4 µm or even smaller signal period. The signal read by most encoder heads is sinusoidal plus a second signal shifted 90°. Interpolation circuitry can be mounted within the compact head, providing differential quadrature signals comparable to most shaft encoders (see Figure 13). The advantage of this signal is that it can be read by most motion controllers. With internal interpolation, a resolution of up to 50 nm is possible for a scale with 20 µm signal period.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">For applications requiring higher resolution, encoders with a 1 Vpp sinusoidal signal are commonly used. In this case, the interpolation of the encoder signal is done by the motion controller where a higher signal subdivision is achievable. For instance, the XPS controller is capable of a 32,768-fold signal subdivision which results in sub-nm resolution from a 20 µm pitch scale, well below the noise of the encoder signal. With the XPS controller, the resolution accessible to users is limited to a value that is above the encoder noise to provide a meaningful value. But, the internal resolution used by the controller for internal calculations uses always the full data depth.</text></para>

For higher quality speed control, a tachometer is used which produces a voltage or current level proportional to the speed of the motor. Tachometer feedback can change instantaneously with speed change, allowing faster correction and tighter regulation from a controller.</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">An origin switch is a device that defines a repeatable reference point. The switch may be mechanical, such as an on/off switch or hall effect sensor, or it may be an optical device, such as the index pulse (top zero) of optical encoders. Limit switches are used to prevent motion from proceeding beyond a defined point. They are usually located at the ends of stage travel immediately before the stage&apos;s hard travel stops. They can be mechanical or optical and are designed to cut motor power when a limit is encountered. Limit switches are most often associated with linear stages, but rotary stages can also make use of them to avoid problems like cable wind-up. Mechanically actuated micro-switches are often used to cut motor power and prevent over-travel. The repeatability of mechanical switches is limited by their hysteresis and susceptibility to wear.</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">A brushed DC motor essentially consists of a rotor placed in a magnetic field, which causes rotation when current is applied to the motor windings. The rotational speed is proportional to the applied voltage, while the torque is proportional to the current. DC motors are best characterized by their smooth motion and high speeds. A dynamic range of 103 to 104 is commonplace. DC motors also provide good efficiency and a high power/weight ratio. Unlike stepper motors, DC servomotor do not provide full torque when idle.</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">A stepper motor operates using the basic principle of magnetic attraction and repulsion. Steppers convert digital pulses into mechanical shaft rotation. The amount of rotation is directly proportional to the number of input pulses generated, and speed is proportional to pulse frequency. Most stepper motors used today with high precision stages are so called Hybrid motors. They consist of a laminated, toothed stator with coils wounded on the stator teeth and connected together in pairs. The rotor is a multi-pole permanent magnet. Energizing the motor windings, as illustrated in Figure 14, generates the torque required to turn the stepper motor.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">One difference between a DC and a stepper motor is that when a voltage is applied to a DC Servomotor, it will develop both torque and rotation. However, when a voltage is applied to a stepper motor, it will develop only torque. For the stepper motor to rotate, the current applied must be commutated or switched.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Commutation is the principle describing the changes of amplitude and direction of the current flowing in the motor’s electro-magnetic coils. A brushed DC motor is designed to self-commutate while a stepper motor lacks internal commutation.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">By energizing two windings simultaneously, it is possible to electronically divide a full-step motion into a high number of partial steps. This method is called mini-stepping or micro-stepping and can improve the smoothness of motion and resolution of a positioning system. While modern motion controllers are capable of dividing one full-step into a very high number of micro-steps, there is a limit to the number of executable micro-steps per full step for each stepper motor. This motor dependent micro-stepping capability provides the ultimate limit for the motion sensitivity. Furthermore, in practice, the microsteps are not equal and vary by 5-20% depending on the motor design and the load on the motor. This effect limits the speed stability of most stepper motor driven stages at low speed.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Stepper motors are often used in open-loop, a low-cost alternative to closed-loop DC servo systems. The pulse count is a good indicator of position and stepper motors work reliably when used within their specified torque and speed range. However, the motion of a stepper motor becomes unpredictable outside their specified range and skipping steps, extra steps or motor stalling can result. Adding a shaft encoder to the stepper motor is a method to detect unreliable stepper motor behavior.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Stepper motors driven in open-loop develop torque almost instantaneously, faster than with a DC brush motor driven in closed-loop. Hence, stepper motor driven stages can deal with mechanical stiction better than DC motor driven stages that often generate position overshoots when the motor torque exceeds the stiction. This position overshoot, combined with mechanical hysteresis in the drive train can limit the minimum incremental motion capability of stages with DC brush motors. The same stage, equipped with a high quality stepper motor, could deliver more consistent results when moved in very small steps.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">It is a common misconception that stepper motors don’t develop heat when stationary, because this is not an intrinsic function of the motor. It entirely depends on the capabilities of the motion electronics. With most of today’s stepper motor drives, the current on the motor winding is always on. Only some advanced motion controllers, like the XPS, feature an adjustable stand-by current, which automatically reduces the current after the motion.</text></para>

A linear motor consists of a permanent magnet assembly which establishes a magnetic flux, and a coil assembly which generates a force proportional to coil current.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">A major design choice relates to the presence or absence of iron in the coil assembly. There are some market opinions that ironless motors are the higher quality components but this is too simple. Some of the arguments against iron core motors are exaggerated without highlighting the advantages of iron core motors.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">The main advantage of the use of iron in the coil assembly is that it increases the motor efficiency. Consequently, an iron core motor produces approx. 30-40% less heat than a similarly sized ironless motor and can generate 10- 30% more continuous force per unit volume. This is of special importance as temperature variation is the primary error source for high precision mechanics.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">The main disadvantages of iron core motors compared to ironless motors are the strong attractive forces between the coil and magnet assembly and some periodic “cogging” force. The cogging force impacts the achievable speed stability at high speeds, but with high performance electronics like the XPS, a speed ripple from the iron-core motor will be invisible up to speed levels of approx. 100 mm/s. And even at higher speeds, the XPS controller will be able to maintain speed stability of an IMS-LM stage (that uses an iron-core motor) within approx. +/-0.2%.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">The additional magnetic flux of iron core motors results also in an increased inductance. The electrical time constant of brushless motors with iron-based coil assemblies is 5 to 20 times that of ironless designs, the effect of which is to lower the achievable servo bandwidth. This parameter is the key to achieving excellent dynamic performance, and directly determines system stepping time for very short stroke motion. Hence, very short stroke motion in the order of 10 µm can be executed faster with an XM stage that uses an ironless motor, than with an IMS-LM stage that uses an iron-core motor. For these short stroke motions, the maximum speed and acceleration of the stage are irrelevant.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">The decision as to which component moves and which is fixed is application dependent. A moving magnet track imposes a penalty in a higher moving mass and a larger dimensional envelope, but allows a stationary coil cable.

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Traditionally, linear motor designs capable of arbitrary travels have adopted a three-phase coil, with an amplifier that excites the windings in a six-step sequence, based on three digital magnetic field sensors mounted in the coil assembly. If pure, constant velocity motion is required, sinusoidal commutation can be substituted for the simpler six-step sequencing. This can be accomplished either by using the linear encoder to determine coil current relationships (like that implemented in the XPS controller), or by utilizing two analog magnetic field (Hall) sensors mounted in the coil assembly to proportion coil currents. The encoder-based method requires that the servo controller provide two analog DAC outputs per axis and a “phase-finding” initialization routine must be performed upon power-up. Both the encoder-based and the analog sensor-based methods of sinusoidal commutation require specialized servo amplifiers to accommodate the new inputs.</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">    Controlled test bench data taken for 21 measurement points distributed over the full travel of the stage. This high number of measurement points ensures careful identification of the stage’s characteristics along its entire travel range. A typical positioner may perform very well along specific points along its travel, but it might have significantly different characteristics at other points due to imperfections in the bearings or in the drive screw. Procedures that collect only a few data points (4 or 5 for example) do not accurately represent the true performance of the positioner and may not truly meet published specifications along its full travel range. Newport&apos;s dedicated metrology room is temperature stabilized to 19.5°C +/-1.5°C. All stages undergoing testing are stored in the room for a minimum of 12 hours for stabilization before the actual measurements are taken. A certified third party metrology institute provides regular calibration of the test tools to guarantee the highest precision possible.</text></para>

The standard deviation is calculated from the positioning data taken at all 21 measurement points in the forward and reverse directions. With 4 cycles of motion, this makes a total of 168 data points. The high number of data points and the 3-sigma approach provides a very accurate indication of the worst-case repeatability with 96% certainty. This means when moving to the same position hundreds of times, 96% of the moves will be repeatable within the specified span.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">    NOTE: It is important to clarify that Newport specifies positioning products as the &quot;guaranteed worst-case repeatability&quot; as opposed to some companies that specify an RMS (Root Mean Square) or mean repeatability to make their data look more impressive. RMS or “mean” repeatability is the expected repeatability error when moving to the same position many times. It converts to only a 1-sigma specification certainty. This significant difference means that when comparing a product with a mean RMS repeatability of 0.5 µm this same product would have a 1.5 µm specification using Newport&apos;s A167 procedure, which is more representative of the actual performance of the product.</text></para>

Therefore, the properties of these materials will be directly compared in the following discussion. Materials are sometimes selected by emphasizing a single property, such as thermal expansion. This is unwise as it is not likely to result in a good choice for general use. Therefore all relevant material properties should be considered.</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Stiffness</text></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Stiffness is a measure of the amount of stress (force/area) required to cause a given amount of strain (normalized deformation). Stress and strain are proportional and related by the equation σ = Eε, where σ and ε are stress and strain respectively and E is Young’s Modulus, which is material dependent. A material is stiffer for larger values of E and more compliant for smaller values. For example, stainless steel is approximately three times stiffer than that of aluminum (see table). Aluminum, on the other hand, is 1.3 times more compliant than brass. Specific stiffness (Young’s Modulus divided by the material density) is important when settling time or vibration immunity is an issue. Components with the same shape and specific stiffness will have the same fundamental resonant frequencies. Higher specific stiffness results in higher resonant frequencies, faster settling times, and a reduction in vibration disturbances.</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"></para>
    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Temperature changes cause size and shape changes in a mounting component. The amount of size and shape change is dependent on the size of the component, the amount of temperature change, and the material used. The equation relating dimensional change to temperature change is ΔL = αLΔT where α is the material dependent coefficient of thermal expansion. The thermal expansion of stainless steel is roughly half that of aluminum. This can be important when the mounting component is being used in an application requiring interferometric stability. Note that aluminum is the best choice when temperature change across the component is non-uniform. This situation arises when mounting a power source, such as a laser diode. Because the diode is hotter than the surrounding environment, it dissipates heat through the mount setting up a temperature gradient along the component. The thermal conductivity of aluminum is ten times greater than that of stainless steel so heat can be dissipated more readily, thus reducing the magnitude of the thermal gradients and distortion. The distortion caused by non-uniform temperature changes is proportional to the coefficient of thermal expansion divided by the coefficient of thermal conductivity. Thus, aluminum distorts on the order of three times less than stainless steel in a non-uniform temperature environment. Brass - though nearly as thermally expansive as aluminum, has a coefficient of thermal conduction nearly a factor of two worse and thus is not as good as aluminum in this situation.</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Aluminum: Aluminum is a lightweight material, resistant to cold flow or creep, with good stiffness-to-weight ratio. It has a relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion, but it also has a high thermal conductivity, making it a good choice in applications where there will be thermal gradients or where rapid acclimatization to temperature changes is required. Aluminum is fast machining, cost effective, and widely used in component structures. Aluminum is non-rusting and generally corrosion-resistant in a laboratory environment, even when the surface is unprotected. It has an excellent finish when anodized. However, anodized surfaces are highly porous, making them unsuitable for use in high vacuum. Vacuum applications require the use of unfinished aluminum surfaces.</text></para>

It also has about half the thermal expansion of aluminum, making it an excellent choice in typical laboratory environments where there are uniform changes in temperature. Machining of steel is much slower than aluminum, making steel components considerably more expensive. Corrosion of steel is a serious problem. Stainless steel alloys avoid the corrosion problems of other steels. Stainless steel is well suited to high vacuum applications, but the design of the component must also incorporate other factors.

The thermal expansion of brass is similar to that of aluminum, but its thermal conductivity is nearly a factor of two worse. It is, however, a good wear material. The main use of brass is in wear reduction; it is often used as a dissimilar metal to avoid self-welding effects with steel or stainless steel screws or shafts. Brass is used in some high-precision applications requiring extremely high resistance to creep and can be diamond turned for extremely smooth surfaces.</text></para>

Many of the materials used in standard components will outgas in a high vacuum, resulting in a “virtual” leak, which limits the ability to maintain a high vacuum. Highly porous anodized aluminum surfaces can trap large amounts of air molecules, resulting in significant outgassing. For those components, within this catalog, specified as “Vacuum Compatible” we perform the following in preparation:</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Image Caption" translate="true">Products with anodized aluminum are created without anodize. As such, we only use unanodized aluminum, stainless steel or equivalent materials. Plastic knobs and handles are either removed or replaced (at additional cost) with high vacuum materials such as steel or Delrin. In some cases, you may choose to maintain the plastic knob due to incremental costs associated with producing an alternative design. In spite of plastics permeability it is common to use plastics in vacuum systems because of their insulating properties and price. Holes not tapped through are vented; or special vented hardware is used. Hardware and lubricants are changed to special vacuum compatible materials. Finished units are completely cleaned and sealed in appropriate packaging material.</text></para>

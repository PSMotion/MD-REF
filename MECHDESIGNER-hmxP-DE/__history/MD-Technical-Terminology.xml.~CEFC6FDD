Modulus of Elasticity - also known as Young&apos;s Modulus. &#160;It is a material &#160;property relating the stress in the material to how much it is strained, and is &#160;typically obtained by pulling a sample of the material in a testing machine. &#160;It &#160;is a linear ratio of stress over strain, so it has the same units of stress &#160;(psi, ksi, Pa, MPa) since strain is without units, and is valid up to the point &#160;of yielding in the material. &#160;Materials which are linear-elastic follow Hooke&apos;s &#160;Law.</text></para>

Materials for which Hooke&apos;s &#160;law is a useful approximation are known as linear-elastic or &quot;Hookean&quot; &#160;materials. Hooke&apos;s law in simple terms says that strain is directly proportional &#160;to stress. (Definition taken directly from Wikipedia.)</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true"> 12. normal &#160;stress - if you were to take a look at an infinitesimally small cube &#160;oriented in the global coordinate system, the normal stress is the stress &#160;that develops normal to the face. &#160;Normal stress is denoted by the Greek letter sigma, σ, and subscript is the face that it is normal to, eg. σx. &#160;From last time, shear stress is defined as &#160;the stress that is tangential to the face, usually denoted by a Greek tau, τ, and subscript is the face and then the direction of &#160;shear, for example τxz is on the x-face in the &#160;z-direction. &#160;Thus for a given cube face, there is a single normal stress and &#160;two shear stresses. &#160;Both normal and shear stresses are vectors, having &#160;direction and magnitude, and since the proposed cube we are looking at is &#160;infinitesimally small, the stresses on opposing faces are equal in magnitude but &#160;in the opposite direction. &#160;Thus for a given cube, there are a grand total of 3 &#160;normal stresses and 6 shear stresses. &#160;The below image can be helpful in &#160;describing the stress vectors:</text></para>

    <para styleclass="Normal"><text styleclass="Normal" translate="true">14. &#160;principal stresses - at any point in a stressed body (in this case &#160;let&apos;s take the same point as given above), there exists three planes where there &#160;are no shear stresses and the normal stress vectors to these planes are in &#160;&quot;principal&quot; directions, and are denoted σ1, σ2, and σ3, (or &#160;in SW SIM we name them P1, P2 and P3). &#160;The normal and shear stresses from the &#160;stress cube above go through a matrix transformation (resulting in a matrix &#160;where all off-axis terms are zero) to obtain the principal directions, which are &#160;orthogonal to one another meaning that they are completely independent &#160;directions. &#160;It is always true that P1 ≥ P2 ≥ P3. &#160;In an pure tensile load, all &#160;three principal stresses are positive; in a pure compressive load, all 3 are &#160;negative; and when the signs of the principal stresses are mixed (P1 is positive &#160;and P3 is negative), then this usually means the body is in bending. &#160;I &#160;typically recommend to set your Simulation options to always show P1 and P3 &#160;stress components in addition to von Mises stress.</text></para>
